#Very Simple Post Images

... is a Wordpress Plugin that makes adding adding images to a post gallery as simple as
possible.

We believe that the Media Libary UI is extremely powerful; but can be confusing to casual
users of Wordpress.

This plugin tackles that problem by embedding the most common operations that you want
to do with post images in a metabox right next to the post content.


*Upload multiple images
*Delete an image
*Select the featured image
